# Asteroid

This project is a recreation of the classic multidirectional shooter video game, Asteroids. The goal is to shoot as many asteroids possible to increase your score. 
The asteroids (obstacles) are spawned randomly and each varying in size and design to ensure a fresh experience every time you play.
